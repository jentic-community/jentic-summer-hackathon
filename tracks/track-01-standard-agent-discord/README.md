# Track 01 â€“ Standard Agent (Discord Bot)

**Goal**: Build a Discord bot powered by Standard Agent that can execute complex tasks using Jentic's tool ecosystem.

**Time Estimate**: 3-6 hours  
**Difficulty**: Beginner to Intermediate  
**Perfect for**: Developers new to AI agents who want to see immediate, interactive results

## What You'll Build

A Discord bot that users can interact with to:
- Execute multi-step tasks through natural language
- Access real-world APIs via Jentic's tool platform
- Demonstrate autonomous reasoning and error recovery

**Example interactions**:
- User: "!agent Find the latest 3 AI papers on Figshare and summarize them"
- Bot: *Plans task â†’ Searches Figshare â†’ Retrieves papers â†’ Summarizes â†’ Posts results*

## Prerequisites

### Technical Requirements
- Python 3.11+
- Basic familiarity with Discord bots
- Understanding of environment variables

### Accounts & Credentials
- **Discord Developer Account** - Create a bot application
- **Jentic Account** - Agent API key with appropriate scopes
- **LLM Provider** - API key for OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google

### Knowledge Prerequisites
- Basic Python programming
- Understanding of async/await (helpful but not required)
- Familiarity with command-line interfaces

## Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### Phase 1: Environment Setup (30 minutes)

#### 1. Create Discord Bot
1. Go to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Click "New Application" â†’ Name it (e.g., "Hackathon Agent Bot")
3. Go to "Bot" section â†’ "Add Bot"
4. Copy the bot token (keep it secret!)
5. Under "Privileged Gateway Intents" enable:
   - Message Content Intent
   - Server Members Intent (optional)

#### 2. Invite Bot to Server
1. Go to "OAuth2" â†’ "URL Generator"
2. Select scopes: `bot`
3. Select permissions: `Send Messages`, `Read Message History`, `Use Slash Commands`
4. Copy generated URL, open in browser, invite to your test server

#### 3. Set Up Development Environment
```bash
# Clone the starter template
git clone [this track's template directory]
cd track-01-standard-agent-discord

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 4. Configure Environment Variables
```bash
# Copy the example environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your credentials
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN="your-discord-bot-token"
JENTIC_AGENT_API_KEY="your-jentic-agent-api-key"
OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"  # or ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, GEMINI_API_KEY
LLM_MODEL="gpt-4"  # or claude-sonnet-4, gemini-pro
```

### Phase 2: Basic Bot Implementation (60 minutes)

#### 1. Test the Starter Bot
```bash
python main.py
```

You should see:
```
âœ… Discord bot logged in as YourBot#1234
âœ… Standard Agent initialized
ðŸ¤– Bot ready! Try '!ping' in Discord
```

#### 2. Test Basic Commands
In your Discord server:
- `!ping` â†’ Bot responds with "Pong!"
- `!help` â†’ Shows available commands
- `!agent hello` â†’ Bot uses Standard Agent to respond

#### 3. Understand the Code Structure
The main.py file shows how to:
- Connect to Discord with proper intents
- Initialize Standard Agent with your model
- Handle both text commands and slash commands
- Process user queries through the agent
- Send results back to Discord

### Phase 3: Enhanced Functionality (90-120 minutes)

#### 1. Add Slash Commands
Implement modern Discord slash commands for better UX.

#### 2. Add Progress Indicators
Show users the agent is working on complex tasks.

#### 3. Add Error Handling & User Feedback
Provide helpful error messages and troubleshooting tips.

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Optional, 60+ minutes)

#### 1. Context-Aware Conversations
Track conversation history for multi-turn interactions.

#### 2. Rich Discord Embeds
Make responses more visually appealing.

#### 3. Command Categories & Help System
Organize functionality into logical groups.

## Testing Your Bot

### Basic Functionality Tests
- [ ] Bot connects to Discord successfully
- [ ] Responds to `!ping` command
- [ ] Can execute simple agent queries
- [ ] Error messages are helpful and user-friendly

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Agent can access Jentic tools (try a search query)
- [ ] Multi-step tasks work (try "find and summarize")
- [ ] Authentication works for protected APIs
- [ ] Bot handles rate limits gracefully

### User Experience Tests
- [ ] Commands are intuitive and discoverable
- [ ] Response times are reasonable (< 30 seconds for most tasks)
- [ ] Error messages help users fix issues
- [ ] Bot behavior is consistent

## Deliverables

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
- [ ] Working Discord bot that connects and responds
- [ ] Integration with Standard Agent for task execution
- [ ] At least 2 working commands (e.g., `!ask` and `!help`)
- [ ] Basic error handling
- [ ] Clear setup instructions in README

### Enhanced Version
- [ ] Slash commands for modern Discord UX
- [ ] Progress indicators for long-running tasks
- [ ] Rich embed responses
- [ ] Conversation context awareness
- [ ] Multiple specialized commands

### Documentation
- [ ] Complete README with setup instructions
- [ ] Example interactions with screenshots
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide
- [ ] List of supported capabilities/APIs

## Common Challenges & Solutions

### Discord API Issues
**Problem**: Bot doesn't respond to messages
**Solutions**:
- Check Message Content Intent is enabled
- Verify bot has proper permissions in the server
- Ensure bot token is correct and not expired

### Standard Agent Issues
**Problem**: "No tools found" or "401 Unauthorized"
**Solutions**:
- Verify `JENTIC_AGENT_API_KEY` is set correctly
- Check agent scope includes required APIs in Jentic dashboard
- Test API access with a simple Jentic SDK call

### Performance Issues
**Problem**: Bot responses are slow or timeout
**Solutions**:
- Implement async patterns properly
- Add progress indicators for user feedback
- Set reasonable timeouts on agent calls
- Cache frequently used results

## Getting Help

### Quick Debugging
```bash
# Test Jentic connection
python -c "
import os
from jentic import Jentic
client = Jentic()
print('âœ… Jentic connection works')
"

# Test Discord connection
python -c "
import discord
import os
client = discord.Client(intents=discord.Intents.default())
@client.event
async def on_ready():
    print(f'âœ… Discord connection works: {client.user}')
    await client.close()
client.run(os.getenv('DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN'))
"
```
