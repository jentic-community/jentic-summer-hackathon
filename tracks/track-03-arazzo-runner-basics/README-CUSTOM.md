# Track 03 - Arazzo Runner Basics - Custom Implementation

## Overview

This implementation of Track 03 demonstrates mastery of Arazzo workflow fundamentals through hands-on creation of multi-step API orchestrations. The track includes both the provided learning examples and a custom-built workflow that showcases real-world integration patterns.

## What We Built

### ✅ Environment Setup
- Python 3.13 virtual environment with all dependencies
- Arazzo Runner 0.8.22 installed and configured
- API credentials configured for NewsAPI, OpenAI, Discord, and Jentic

### ✅ Workflow Analysis & Learning
Studied and analyzed 5 comprehensive workflow examples:

1. **[`01-hello-world.arazzo.yaml`](workflows/01-hello-world.arazzo.yaml)** - Basic API chaining (time, IP, location)
2. **[`02-parameterized.arazzo.yaml`](workflows/02-parameterized.arazzo.yaml)** - Input parameters and data flow
3. **[`03-error-handling.arazzo.yaml`](workflows/03-error-handling.arazzo.yaml)** - Robust error handling patterns
4. **[`03-real-world-integration.arazzo.yaml`](workflows/03-real-world-integration.arazzo.yaml)** - Multi-API with authentication
5. **[`05-conditional-workflow.arazzo.yaml`](workflows/05-conditional-workflow.arazzo.yaml)** - Advanced conditional logic

### ✅ Custom Workflow Creation
Built **[`06-ai-news-summarizer.arazzo.yaml`](workflows/06-ai-news-summarizer.arazzo.yaml)** - A production-ready workflow that:

- **Integrates Multiple APIs**: NewsAPI + OpenAI + validation services
- **Implements Authentication**: API keys and Bearer tokens
- **Processes Data Between Steps**: News articles → AI summaries → formatted reports
- **Handles Errors Gracefully**: Validation failures and API errors
- **Uses Advanced Patterns**: Conditional execution, dependency management
- **Produces Real Value**: Automated AI-powered news summarization

## Custom Workflow: AI News Summarizer

### Architecture
```
NewsAPI → Validate → Format → OpenAI → Final Report

### Usage Examples
```bash
# Basic usage - technology news with concise summaries
arazzo-runner execute-workflow workflows/06-ai-news-summarizer.arazzo.yaml \
  --workflow-id aiNewsSummarizer

# Advanced usage - business news for technical audience
arazzo-runner execute-workflow workflows/06-ai-news-summarizer.arazzo.yaml \
  --workflow-id aiNewsSummarizer \
  --inputs '{
    "news_category": "business",
    "max_articles": 5,
    "summary_style": "detailed",
    "target_audience": "technical"
  }'
```
